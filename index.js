 * @returns {Promise<Array<string>>} - A promise that resolves to an array of strings, 
 *         where each string is a line from the file. If reading the file fails, 
 *         the promise rejects with an error message.
 * 
 * The function creates a readable stream for the file at filePath, then uses the readline 
 * interface to read the file line by line. It collects all lines in an array and returns 
 * this array once the 'close' event indicates that the file stream has been fully read.
 * If there's an error reading the file, the function will reject the promise with the
